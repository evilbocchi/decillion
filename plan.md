# üöÄ Million.js-Style Roblox-TS Renderer: The Gameplan

**Your Mission:**  
Build a Roblox-TS compiler plugin/transformer that takes declarative UI and spits out *turbo-optimized* Luau, √† la Million.js.  
Here‚Äôs the mental model and component stack to start with:

---

## 1. **Input: TypeScript UI Code**
Think a JSX-like DSL for Roblox-TS.

```tsx
// Example: 
return (
  <frame>
    <textlabel Text={props.name} />
    <uigridlayout />
    {props.items.map(item => <textbutton Text={item} />)}
  </frame>
)
```

---

## 2. **Compiler Magic Layer**
This is where the sauce happens.  
**You need:**  
- **Custom TS transformers** (AST plugins)
- Optionally, a Babel-like macro pass if you want JSX

**What it does:**
- **Analyze the tree statically:** What‚Äôs static, what‚Äôs dynamic?
- **Blockify:** Split UI into ‚Äúblocks‚Äù (subtrees/components) that only re-render if their inputs change (Million.js Block memoization)
- **Generate update conditions:** Write code that only updates nodes if their props/state actually changed.

---

## 3. **Runtime Layer**
What runs in Luau after compilation.

- **Block instances:** Each UI block is an object/class/function with a ‚ÄúshouldUpdate‚Äù check.
- **Efficient diffing:** Skip traversing children if ‚ÄúshouldUpdate‚Äù returns false.
- **Patch system:** Only mutate Roblox Instances that *need* it.

---

## 4. **Integration Points**
- **React-like API**: So devs don‚Äôt ragequit learning a new paradigm.
- **Optimized event hooks:** So you can wire up signals/events without extra lag.
- **Dev tools:** Optional, but logging/diagnostics for debugging block skips is chef‚Äôs kiss.

---

## 5. **Bonus: Static Extraction for Static UI**
If you can detect 100% static UI, **generate Luau that just builds it once, no reconciliation needed.**

---

# üß© **High-Level Architecture Flow**

1. **Write UI in Roblox-TS JSX**
2. **Compiler plugin transforms source:**
   - Detects block boundaries
   - Generates block memoization wrappers
   - Emits ‚ÄúshouldUpdate‚Äù logic per block
3. **Output Luau code:**
   - Each block is a function/class
   - UI tree is built with block skips
   - Patches only what‚Äôs needed when state/props change

---

# üõ†Ô∏è **Components Checklist**

- [ ] **TS transformer or macro** (core of the system)
- [ ] **TSX parser**
- [ ] **Block registry/generator**
- [ ] **shouldUpdate logic generator**
- [ ] **Efficient React-like runtime for blocks**
- [ ] **Patch/diff engine for Roblox Instances**
- [ ] **Testing harnesses** (gotta see the speedup, right?)

---

# üß† **Tips for Success**

- **Start with basic block memoization:** Even a simple static/dynamic prop check will give instant perf.
- **Profile Roblox UI instance creation and mutation:** Know your enemy.
- **Keep dev ergonomics in mind:** If it sucks to use, nobody will adopt.

---

# TL;DR
- **Compiler plugin** does the heavy lifting, not runtime.
- **Blockify and memoize** everything you can.
- **Only touch the Roblox UI tree when you have to.**
- **Win.**
